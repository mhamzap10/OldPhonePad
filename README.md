# OldPhonePad

##Problem

*Here is an old phone keypad with alphabetical letters, a backspace key, and a send button. Each button has a number to identify it and pressing a button multiple times will cycle through the letters on it allowing each button to represent more than one letter.

## Solution

*I have used Two Dimensional Array to store the corresponding keys.
